# GCDA_CaseStudy_Cyclistic_2020Q1
This notebook contains my first case study for my Googleâ€™s Data Analytics Professional Certificate. This case study required the analyst to follow to the steps of the data analysis process (ask, prepare, process, analyze, share,and act) for a data set that represents a fictional company, Cyclistic Bike-Share. 

For this case study our objective business task is to find how bike usage differs from annual membership holders to casual riders who use the Cyclistic bike service in order to understand the best marketing strategy to convert casual riders into membership holders, which will maximize profits. This project looks to find the main differences between casual riders and member riders.
